# Running the Parser

```./run_parser``` needs to be pointed to a directory with test_suites in them (see the code for more details).

Locally, I had a ```test-suites``` directory in the test-suite-extractor root. Place the test suites in the test-suites folder and execute ```./run_parser``` or reconfigure the bash script to look whereever you happen to have your test suites.
